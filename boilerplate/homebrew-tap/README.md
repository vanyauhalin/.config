# Homebrew [PACKAGE]() Formula

[![test action status](https://github.com/vanyauhalin/homebrew-PACKAGE/workflows/test/badge.svg)](https://github.com/vanyauhalin/homebrew-PACKAGE/actions)

```sh
$ brew tap vanyauhalin/PACKAGE
$ brew install PACKAGE
```

To change the current version of PACKAGE use the `link` subcommand with the `--overwrite` flag.

```sh
$ brew install PACKAGE@1 PACKAGE@2
$ brew link --overwrite PACKAGE@2
```

Feel free to remind me in [issues](https://github.com/vanyauhalin/homebrew-PACKAGE/issues) to update the formula if I forget.
